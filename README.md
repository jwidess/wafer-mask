## wafer-mask

**This is a simple 3D viewer for simulating an "art" silicon wafer with an image mask. The program uses WebGL via Three.js**  

\*I created this program to support myself and other students in a nanomanufacturing course. Our first assignment involved designing an 'art' wafer with the goal of deepening our understanding of the photolithography masking process. I wanted a way to simulate what different images may look like masked on to a wafer, and thus sparked the inspiration to create this program!

> \*GPT-4.1 & Claude 3.5 Sonnet were used heavily for the majority of the program as I am not familiar with Three.js and just wanted to make this as a fun mini-project! (P.S. Claude 3.5 Sonnet was far better at handling shaders)
